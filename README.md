# Stax
Stax is a crowdsourced website to share deals found in stores so that others can take advantage of them as well. The user uploads a deal description and prices, along with an image displaying the product. They use the Google API to select which store they found the deal in. Once the deal is uploaded, it will show up in user's feeds. They can sort their feed by price, date uploaded, or distance from them. They also have the ability to upvote and downvote deals, as well as favorite them if they wish to save them for later.
